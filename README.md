# Artist-lyrics-search

This is an Electron/React app that locates song titles and lyrics for any artist entered into the search bar. This app uses the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to fetch the song titles for the given artist, and it currently uses the [Musixmatch API](https://developer.musixmatch.com) to fetch the lyrics for each song.

## Motivation

Whenever I try to use lyrics to find a certian song from an artist, I have to look at separate songs until I find the right one. I thought it would be better to have all of the lyrics from all of the artist's songs in a single page to make song searching faster and easier.
