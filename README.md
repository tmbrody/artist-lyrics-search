# singer-lyrics-search

This is an Electron/React app that currently locates some song titles and lyrics for any artist that is set up in the code and entered into the search bar. This app uses the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to fetch the song titles, and it uses the [STANDS4 Lyrics API](https://www.lyrics.com/lyrics_api.php) to fetch the song lyrics. Make sure to enter your Spotify and Lyrics API credentials in the spotify.js and .env files before running the build and start-electron commands. The vulnerabilities within the dev-dependencies and other small issues will be addressed soon enough.
